# "Shebl" Quadruped Robot Control System

Walking robots have a potential to traverse with greater mobility in certain types of terrain in a more efficient and stable manner than more conventional robots, using wheels or tracks. We built a simple quadruped robot “Shebl” with statically balanced gaits, and simple 3-DoF leg trajectory algorithm that ensure the stability of the robot motion. The motion of the robot is planned by determining the supporting force for each leg, which in turn will determine how the robot should shift its weight in order to remain statically balanced.

This repository contains the project's model and figures, C code, and the thesis file.
